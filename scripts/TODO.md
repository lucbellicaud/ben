- Add signals when defending
- When declaring we want the declaring CardPlayer to play for Dummy (Sort of sharing knowledge)
- Play on ben.aalborgdata from a uploaded PBN-file
- When bidding rollout, consider expanding the tree for more that the best bid if other bids above threshold



- Lefty in board 31 Camrose deals
- Consider ignoring doubles
- If dummy and pip always play lowest
- Add Hint for playing (Show the card BEN would have played)
- If only low scores from nn, consider other (final) contracts
- Allow the GUI to disable simulation during bidding
- Chakc that when void is know all samples are according to that knowledge

- Consider using SVG-cards for GUI
- Switch between the different simulation engines depending on level of bidding
- Consider disabling simulation twhen responding to 4N

- When rollout bidding, chack for bridge illogical sequences: 1H-2C-X-P-P-3C

- Adding probability of bidding to the double dummy estimates

- Rollout bidding should probably estimate based on how likely it matches partners hand (Camrose board 9)
